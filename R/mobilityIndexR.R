#' mobilityIndexR: A package for calculating transition matrices and mobility indices
#'
#' This package measures mobility in a population through transition matrices and mobility indices.
#' Relative, mixed, and absolute transition matrices are supported for various use cases. With respect to indices,
#' the Prais-Bibby, Absolute Movement, Origin Specific, and Shorrocks indices are supported. Example income and
#' grade data are included for demos.
